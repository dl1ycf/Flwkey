\section flwkeyDesc FLWKEY

flwkey is a simple interface to the Winkeyer series of CW code generators.
It can be used with both the Winkeyer 1.x and 2.x series as well as the
RigExpert and other units that either use the K1EL chipset or emulate it's
behavior.  flwkey can run on Linux, Puppy, OS X and Windows computers.

The main control window for flwkey provides all of the routine control
of the Winkeyer chip:

<center>
\image latex main.png "" width=5.0in
\image html main.png ""
</center>

The upper panel contains text that has been sent by the Winkeyer chip.  The
lower panel is where you type text to transmit.  Both panels have pop-up
menus that are obtained by right-clicking on the panel.  The transmit text
may also come from a computer text file (plain text only) or from the
message store.  Text from a file may be inserted into the transmit text
via the pop-up menu or by dragging and dropping the file onto the transmit
text panel.  The function keys F1 ... F12 or their on screen button may be
selected to transmit the respective macro contents.  The message store or
macros can be edited and also contain tags or data references that are
filled in at the time the data is copied to the transmit panel.

The Send button initiates or ends the sending of the transmit panel text.  It
behaves as a toggle.

The Cancel button will abort any text being sent by the Winkeyer chip and
also clear the transmit text panel.

The Tune button will cause the Winkeyer to hold the KEY LINE down and thus
allow you to tune the transmitter.  It behaves as a toggle.

The lighted diamonds at the lower left annunciate the status of the Winkeyer.

The following short cut keys can be used in lieu of the mouse button action:

<ul>
	<li>Alt-T - toggle the Tune button </li>
	<li>Alt-S - toggle the Send button </li>
	<li>Alt-L - Log button closure </li>
	<li>Esc - Cancel button closure </li>
</ul>


The fields are associated with the logbook entry and also used for macro
expansion:

<ul>
  <li>STA - callsign of station being worked</li>
  <li>NAM - name of other operator</li>
  <li>Freq - frequency (in MHz) of transmitted signal</li>
  <li>X_in - contest exchange received</li>
</ul>

\section sConfig Configuring

<center>
\image latex select_serial_port.png "Serial Port" width=2.8in
\image html select_serial_port.png "Serial Port"
</center>
<br>

Open the serial port selection dialog and select the port to which your
Winkeyer is attached.  Flwkey should find all of the serial ports on the
computer and populate the combo box selector.

<center>
\image latex operator.png "Operator" width=3.0in

Open the Operator dialog and enter your callsign, name, QTH and Locator.

<center>

</center>
<br>

Select the Configure / Parameters menu item to open up the Parameters dialog.

You can set up the Winkeyer to suit your particular operating style.  Refer
to your Winkeyer manual for details on the various settings.

<center>

</center>
<br>

Select the Configure / Messages to open up the message editor.  You can also
open this dialog by right-clicking on any of the macro buttons.  You can
change the macros to suit your need.  The examples shown should give you a
good idea as to how the various tags are applied.  The <STA> and <NAM> tags
are associated with the main dialog entries with the same names.  Press the
"Apply" button to see your changes reflected on the main dialog.

\section sLogBook Logbook

Flwkey maintains a logbook using the same type of ADIF file that FLDIGI
uses.  The logbook menu provides you with nearly the same type of logbook
support that is available in FLDIGI.

<center>
\image latex logbook-menu.png "Log Menu" width=1.25in
\image html logbook-menu.png "Log Menu"
</center>
<br>

Please refer to the fldigi logbook help for information on merging, exporting
and Cabrillo usage.

Do not open up the same logbook file with flwkey and fldigi concurrently.  If
you use flwkey and fldigi at the same time I recommend keeping the logbook
with fldigi or maintaining a separate CW only log with flwkey.  The two log
books can be merged as needed.

When the contest duplicate checking is not being used the program will
search the log data base for the last QSO for the STA entry.  If it is
found the NAM will be filled in for you.

\section sContest Contest

<center>
\image latex contest.png "Contest" width=5.2in
\image html contest.png "Contest"
</center>
<br>

The contest capability of flwkey is very simple.

<ul>
	<li>You enter the starting value for the serial exchange. Click
		leading zeros if you want the exchange to be sent as 09, 015 etc.
		The leading zero will be prepended to all values less than 100.</li>
    <li>If the contest allows a duplicate after a specified period of minutes
        you enter that value in the Time Span entry and also check the Ck Time
        Span box.</li>
    <li>If entries are allowed on multiple bands check the Ck Band box</li>
    <li>Finally check the Ck Dups entry.</li>
</ul>

During the contest a duplicate is indicated by the background color for the
main panel STA entry.

\section sEventLog Event Log

You can monitor the data stream between flwkey and the Winkeyer by opening
up the Event log and then setting the reporting level to the Debug setting.
The log can be saved, reviewed and submitted for analysis if you are having
problems with your setup.
