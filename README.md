# Flwkey
David Freese's (W1HKJ) FLWKEY program, slightly adapted and modified:

- some small but obvious error corrections
- small changes such that flwkey compiles on recent versions of MacOS
- If configured with "configure CXXFLAGS=-DNO_XML",
then all XML stuff (rig control, logbook) is left out such that
the flwkey window occupies much less space.

TODO:

Read/Write WinKey EEPROM, and add user interface to change the
"standalone" settings, including the CW texts that are produced
in standalone mode when pushing one off the buttons.
